void arrays() {
    /*
     Arrays are just allocated contiguous blocks of memory
     They are objects, you cannot access properties like length
     Maximum length of the array must be explicitly recorded. Cannot be changed

     e.g., int a[10]; allocates space for 10 integers in one continuous block


    The name of the array variable can be used as a poniter
    In int *pointer = a, we know that "a" is a pointer to the first element in the array

    Array Itteration
    ----------------
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // i = index, a = array
        printf("Value at %d is %d\n", i, a[i]
     */
}
