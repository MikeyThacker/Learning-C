void strings() {
    /*
     Strings are implemented as an array of characters
     Must end with an additional terminating element, the null character, '\0'

     e.g., "Hello" = {'H", 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}

     Common Functions are implemented in the string library
     Import using an include statement at top of file:
     #include <string.h>
     All string functions in the C libraries will use the '\0' character to
        detect the end of a string
